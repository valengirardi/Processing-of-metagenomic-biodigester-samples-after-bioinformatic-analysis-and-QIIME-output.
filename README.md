## Introduction

The goal of this repository is to provide a comprehensive workflow for the processing of metagenomic biodigester samples. After the initial bioinformatic analysis and obtaining the output from QIIME (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology), these scripts will help in further analyzing and interpreting the data.

## Prerequisites

Before using this repository, ensure you have the following software installed:

- Python 3.x
- QIIME 2
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/metagenomic-biodigester-processing.git
cd metagenomic-biodigester-processing

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

##Usage
# Data Preparation
QIIME Output: Ensure you have the QIIME output files (e.g., feature table, taxonomy classification, metadata).
Configuration: Adjust any paths or parameters directly in the Jupyter notebook or lab_utilis.py if necessary.

#Running the Scripts
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
Open the procesamientometagenomica.ipynb file with Jupyter Notebook.
Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially. The notebook will:
- Load QIIME output files.
- Process and normalize the data.
- Generate visualizations and statistical summaries.

Using lab_utilis.py:
This script contains utility functions used in the Jupyter notebook. You can import and use these functions in your own scripts if needed.
